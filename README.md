## Description

A transactional-based token usually used for transactions at merchant or retail store such as purchasing goods and use ewallet as a payment method. The customer's ewallet app will produce a payment token and merchant can use it to initiate payment processing.

Tulip will provide payment token service like generate a transaction-based token, validate the token and query all payment tokens based on customer ID. This token can be used for one specific transaction only. The token format is 6 digit of numeric data type and has an expiration date time. To secure data transmission between parties, we use JSON Web Token (JWT) Authentication.

## Project Layout

Tulip uses the following project layout:

```
.
├── cmd                  main applications of the project
│   └── server           the API server application
├── config               configuration files for different environments
├── internal             private application and library code
│   ├── paytoken         payment token-related features
│   ├── auth             authentication feature
│   ├── config           configuration library
│   ├── entity           entity definitions and domain logic
│   ├── errors           error types and handling
│   ├── healthcheck      healthcheck feature
│   └── test             helpers for testing purpose
├── migrations           database migrations
├── pkg                  public library code
│   ├── accesslog        access log middleware
│   ├── graceful         graceful shutdown of HTTP server
│   ├── log              structured and context-aware logger
│   └── pagination       paginated list
└── testdata             test data scripts
```

The top level directories `cmd`, `internal`, `pkg` are commonly found in other popular Go projects, as explained in
[Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).

Within `internal` and `pkg`, packages are structured by features in order to achieve the so-called
[screaming architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2011/09/30/Screaming-Architecture.html). For example,
the `paytoken` directory contains the application logic related with the payment token feature.

Within each feature package, code are organized in layers (API, service, repository), following the dependency guidelines
as described in the [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

# Getting Started

```shell
# download the repo
git clone https://github.com/pauluswi/tulip.git

cd tulip

# start a PostgreSQL database server in a Docker container
make db-start

# seed the database with some test data
make testdata

# run the RESTful API server
make run
```

At this time, you have a RESTful API server running at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
It provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /healthcheck`: a healthcheck service provided for health checking purpose (needed when implementing a server cluster)
- `POST /v1/login`: authenticates a user and generates a JWT
- `POST /v1/generate`: generate a 6 digit of numeric token
- `POST /v1/validate`: validate the token whether still valid and not expired
- `GET /v1/getpaytokens/:customer_id`: return all payment(s) token belong to a customer

Try the URL `http://localhost:8080/healthcheck` in a browser, and you should see something like `"OK v1.0.0"` displayed.

If you have `cURL` or some API client tools (e.g. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)), you may try the following
more complex scenarios:

```shell
# authenticate the user via: POST /v1/login
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "demo", "password": "pass"}' http://localhost:8080/v1/login
# should return a JWT token like: {"token":"...JWT token here..."}

# with the above JWT token, access the album resources, such as: GET /v1/xxx
# start example
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer ...JWT token here..." http://localhost:8080/v1/xxx
# end example

# with the above JWT token, hit a endpoint to generate a payment token
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"customer_id": "08110001"}' -H "Authorization: Bearer ...JWT token here..." http://localhost:8080/v1/generate

# with the above JWT token, hit a endpoint to validate a payment token
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"token": "343758"}' -H "Authorization: Bearer ...JWT token here..." http://localhost:8080/v1/validate

# with the above JWT token, hit a endpoint to get all payment token for a specific customer
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer ...JWT token here..." http://localhost:8080/v1/getpaytokens/<customerid>

```

## Updating Database Schema

We use [database migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration) to manage the changes of the
database schema over the whole project development phase. The following commands are commonly used with regard to database
schema changes:

```shell
# Execute new migrations made by you or other team members.
# Usually you should run this command each time after you pull new code from the code repo.
make migrate

# Create a new database migration.
# In the generated `migrations/*.up.sql` file, write the SQL statements that implement the schema changes.
# In the `*.down.sql` file, write the SQL statements that revert the schema changes.
make migrate-new

# Revert the last database migration.
# This is often used when a migration has some issues and needs to be reverted.
make migrate-down

# Clean up the database and rerun the migrations from the very beginning.
# Note that this command will first erase all data and tables in the database, and then
# run all migrations.
make migrate-reset
```

## Managing Configurations

The application configuration is represented in `internal/config/config.go`. When the application starts,
it loads the configuration from a configuration file as well as environment variables. The path to the configuration
file is specified via the `-config` command line argument which defaults to `./config/local.yml`. Configurations
specified in environment variables should be named with the `APP_` prefix and in upper case. When a configuration
is specified in both a configuration file and an environment variable, the latter takes precedence.

The `config` directory contains the configuration files named after different environments. For example,
`config/local.yml` corresponds to the local development environment and is used when running the application
via `make run`.

Do not keep secrets in the configuration files. Provide them via environment variables instead. For example,
you should provide `Config.DSN` using the `APP_DSN` environment variable. Secrets can be populated from a secret
storage (e.g. HashiCorp Vault) into environment variables in a bootstrap script (e.g. `cmd/server/entryscript.sh`)

## Unit Testing and Its Coverage

For testability purpose, unit testings are provided.
We can use golang test package.

```shell
$ go test -v internal/paytoken/*.go -race -coverprofile=coverage.out
=== RUN   TestAPI
=== RUN   TestAPI/get_all
=== RUN   TestAPI/get_unknown
=== RUN   TestAPI/generate_ok

=== RUN   TestAPI/validate_ok
=== RUN   TestAPI/validate_auth_error

PASS
coverage: 78.1% of statements
ok      command-line-arguments  0.671s  coverage: 78.1% of statements
```

## Deployment

The application can be run as a docker container. You can use `make build-docker` to build the application
into a docker image. The docker container starts with the `cmd/server/entryscript.sh` script which reads
the `APP_ENV` environment variable to determine which configuration file to use. For example,
if `APP_ENV` is `qa`, the application will be started with the `config/qa.yml` configuration file.

You can also run `make build` to build an executable binary named `server`. Then start the API server using the following
command,

```shell
./server -config=./config/prod.yml
```
